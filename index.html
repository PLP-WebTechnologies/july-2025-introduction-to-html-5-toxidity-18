              <h3> The First Day of School</h3>
              <p>Published on July 28, 2025 by Samuel Kamawira</p>
              <p>I still remember my first day in primary school the smell of new books, the excitement in the air, and the nervous butterflies in my stomach. I didn’t know it then, but that was the first step in a lifelong journey of learning and discovery.</p>
              <p>Back then, I was curious about everything from how chalk worked to how radios spoke without wires. My teachers always encouraged my inquisitiveness, and I quickly found comfort in classrooms, books, and the thrill of new knowledge.</p>

              <h3>Discovering a Passion for Technology</h3>
              <p>As I advanced through school, I encountered my first computer a dusty old desktop tucked into the corner of the library. It was love at first click. From Paint to PowerPoint, I dove in headfirst, eager to understand how it all worked. That passion eventually led me to coding, where I found the perfect mix of logic, creativity, and problem-solving.</p>

              <h3> High School & Beyond</h3>
              <p>High school brought competitions, science fairs, and group projects. I earned several top grades in computer studies, and I even helped create my school's first digital magazine. These small wins pushed me to pursue software development more seriously, ultimately leading to professional training, internships, and freelance work.</p>
